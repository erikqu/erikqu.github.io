    			<li> I'm a computer science student from the Illinois Institute of Technology.  I have heavy interests in natural language processing and computer security (and blockchain!). 
    				I plan on making my software more relevant this year! <br>I love software,
    				I love everything, and that is not a joke; my interests stem from things modeled and simulated on machines, most of the time.  I have a deep love of both physics and chemistry.  I <span>love </span>Feynman.</li>

    				I absolutely love everything about WIRED. But sometimes I don't have the time to read absolutely all the 
    				articles that I think are interesting, so I made WIREDSummarizer, using textRank's NLP and some scraping techniques, I was
    				able to pull the text, treat it, and summarize it in 150 words or less!  This was also the first time I had actually run 
    				into code outside of class that ran so slow it would have to be treated.

    			<li class = "post"> <p class = "postname"> cryptoTicker </p>
    				<br> <img src= "screenshots/tickergui.PNG" ><br><br>
    				I wanted my first out of school project to be something that I was actually interested in, so I made it about crypto!
    				It auto-updates about every 20 seconds, and pulls the data from CoinMarketCap.  This was also the very first time I 
    				made an actual window for a program I've made.  I think it's great.
