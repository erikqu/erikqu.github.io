    			<li> I'm a junior in Computer Science  from the Illinois Institute of Technology.  I have heavy interests in computer vision and deep learning. 
					I've been programming for a while but I have a fling with Physics.  Feynman is a big inspiration of mine.  I'm currently diving into different problems relating to more classical machine learning.  I'm part of a new club here at IIT, ML@IIT, we're trying to bring networking, tutorials, Kaggle challenges to the general community here that is interested in machine learning and deep learning. </li>
					<br>
					I'm very excited about Nvidia's new RTX GPUs, but not everyone is.  Check out my Medium article:  <a href="https://medium.com/@erikqu/why-is-real-time-ray-tracing-a-big-deal-688b79287325" style = "font-size: 12pt">Why is Ray Tracing a Big Deal?</a>

				    <li class = "post"> <p class = "postname"> Personalized Image Tagging </p>
					Over the summer of 2018 I had the amazing opportunity to do research at the University of Central Florida at CRCV under Dr. Mubarak Shah and Dr. Yogesh Rawat.  We developed a model here shown below that would take past 
					user history into account when generating image tags for a given image.  
					<br>
					This in turn gives us better image labels. I will first delve into some highlights about the project and then get into specifics about the model below. 
					<br>
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li> We made use of NUS-WIDE and YFCC100M, YFCC100M itself being ~1TB of image/user data.</li>
						<li> Since these datasets are based on Flickr, the user data was retrieved manually for every user.</li>
						<li> This is the first time deep learning is used to condense user preferences to generate image labels. </li>
						<li> Provides scalable solution for generating tags using deep learning. </li>
						<li> Adversarial learning used in the process, making use of a discriminator to generate better and better tags. </li>
						<li> We leverage an AE to encode the user vectors, which is then combined with intermediate output of ResNet-50. </li>
						<li> Everything here was done mainly in Keras, although some of our earlier models made use of Caffe.</li>
						<li> <b>Accuracy of this model in Top-K, K@3, is 91% on NUS-WIDE (state of the art),</b> Publication coming soon..</li>
					</ul>

    			<li class = "post"> <p class = "postname">WIREDSummarizer </p>
    				<br> <img src= "screenshots/wiredsum1.PNG" ><br><br>
    				I absolutely love everything about WIRED. But sometimes I don't have the time to read absolutely all the 
    				articles that I think are interesting, so I made WIREDSummarizer. Using textRank's NLP and some scraping techniques, I was
    				able to pull the text, treat it, and summarize it in 150 words or less!  This was also the first time I had actually run 
    				into code outside of class that ran so slow it would have to be treated with a little Cython.

    			</li>
    			<li class = "post"> <p class = "postname"> cryptoTicker </p>
    				<br> <img src= "screenshots/tickergui.PNG" ><br><br>
    				I wanted my first out of school project to be something that I was actually interested in, so I made it about crypto!
    				It auto-updates about every 20 seconds, and pulls the data from CoinMarketCap.  This was also the very first time I 
    				made an actual window for a program I've made.  I think it's great.
