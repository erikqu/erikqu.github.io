    <h1> EnhanceNet PyTorch Implementation </h1>

    <p>
        This is a PyTorch implementation for super resolution, this was meant to be a part of a high performance super resolution project, but did not meet the speed requirements.  The code can be found <a href="http://github/erikqu/EnhanceNet-Pytorch">here</a>  The code is in the form of a GAN (for the adversarial loss) and uses VGG-16 to do the perceptual loss (see the EnhanceNet paper).  Just to be clear, this is simply a PyTorch implementation of a paper, and not my idea.
        The paper can be found <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07919">here</a>.  The model takes a 64x64 image and does 4x SISR on the image to 512x512.
