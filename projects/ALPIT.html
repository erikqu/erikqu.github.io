    <h1> Adversarial Learning for Personalized Image Tagging </h1>

    <p> 
        Over the summer of 2018 I had the amazing opportunity to do research at the University of Central Florida at CRCV under Dr. Mubarak Shah and Dr. Yogesh Rawat. We developed a model here shown below that would take past user history into account when generating image tags for a given image. 
        This in turn gives us better image labels. I will first delve into some highlights about the project and then get into specifics about the model below.

    <div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We made use of NUS-WIDE and YFCC100M, YFCC100M itself being ~1TB of image/user data.</li>
                            <li> Since these datasets are based on Flickr, the user data was retrieved manually for every user.</li>
                            <li> This is the first time deep learning is used to condense user preferences to generate image labels. </li>
                            <li> Provides scalable solution for generating tags using deep learning. </li>
                            <li> Adversarial learning used in the process, making use of a discriminator to generate better and better tags. </li>
                            <li> We leverage an AE to encode the user vectors, which is then combined with intermediate output of ResNet-50. </li>
                            <li> Everything here was done mainly in Keras, although some of our earlier models made use of Caffe.</li>
                            <li> Accuracy of this model in Top-K, K@3, is 91% on NUS-WIDE (state of the art)</li>
                            <li> <b>Submitted to ACM-MM 2019</b></li>
                        </ul>
